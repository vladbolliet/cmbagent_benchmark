      "\n",
      "The Python code implements a solution to the Mountain Climbing problem, which can be modeled as a classic 2-machine flow shop scheduling problem. The goal is to find an optimal sequence of cows for ascent and descent to minimize the total time (makespan).\n",
      "\n",
      "The core of the solution is Johnson's algorithm, a greedy algorithm that provides the optimal schedule for this type of problem. The algorithm works as follows:\n",
      "1.  The cows are partitioned into two groups:\n",
      "    *   Group 1: Cows that are faster to climb up than down (`U(i) < D(i)`).\n",
      "    *   Group 2: Cows that are slower or equally fast to climb up than down (`U(i) >= D(i)`).\n",
      "2.  Group 1 is sorted by their ascent time (`U(i)`) in ascending order. These cows are scheduled first.\n",
      "3.  Group 2 is sorted by their descent time (`D(i)`) in descending order. These cows are scheduled after the cows from Group 1.\n",
      "4.  The final optimal sequence is the concatenation of the sorted Group 1 and sorted Group 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the optimal order is determined, the code simulates the process. It iteratively calculates the time each cow reaches the summit and the time each cow completes its descent, keeping track of the cumulative ascent time and the overall completion time. The final result is the completion time of the last cow in the sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Modifications:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The previous implementation used an incorrect greedy strategy of sorting all cows solely by their descent time (`D(i)`) in descending order. While this happened to produce the correct result for the sample input, it is not the generally optimal solution. The current code replaces this flawed logic with the correct implementation of Johnson's algorithm, which is proven to find the optimal schedule for the 2-machine flow shop problem. The simulation logic remains the same but now operates on the correctly determined optimal sequence.\n",

      "**Code Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Python code implements an efficient algorithm to solve the Farmer John snow boots problem. The core idea is to avoid redundant computations by processing boots and tiles in a sorted order.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the input list is parsed to extract the number of tiles (N), the number of boots (B), the snow depth on each tile, and the capabilities (maximum snow depth s and maximum step size d) of each boot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The algorithm's main optimization comes from sorting. The boots are sorted in descending order of their snow depth capacity (s), and the tiles (excluding the always-passable start and end tiles) are sorted in descending order of their snow depth.\n",
      "\n",
      "A doubly linked list is initialized to represent the sequence of all tiles, which are initially all considered passable. The algorithm then iterates through the sorted boots, from most capable to least. For each boot, it identifies any tiles that are now impassable because their snow depth is greater than the boot's capacity. Since both boots and tiles are sorted by snow depth, this check is done efficiently using a pointer that advances through the sorted tile list.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a tile is marked as impassable, it's removed from the linked list. This removal creates a new, larger gap between the remaining passable tiles. The algorithm keeps track of the maximum gap size encountered so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "For each boot, after updating the impassable tiles and the max_gap, it checks if the boot's maximum step size (d) is greater than or equal to the current max_gap. If it is, the boot is sufficient to make the trek, and the result is marked as 1. Otherwise, it's 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach has a time complexity of O(N log N + B log B) due to the sorting steps, which is efficient enough to pass within the time limits for the given constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Modifications:**\n",
      "\n",
      "No modifications were made to the original code provided by the engineer agent. The code structure and logic were preserved, and formatting was adjusted to meet the required output format.\n",

      "\n",
      "The algorithm's main optimizations are:\n",
      "1.  **Sorting Boots:** The boots are sorted in descending order of their maximum snow depth capacity (`s`). This allows us to process the most capable boots first.\n",
      "2.  **Sorting Tiles:** The tiles with snow are sorted in descending order of their snow depth (`f`).\n",

      "The code iterates through the sorted boots. For each boot, it first removes all tiles that are too deep for it. Since both boots and tiles are sorted by depth, this is done efficiently with a single pass over the tiles list. As tiles are removed from the linked list, the gap between the remaining passable tiles might increase. The algorithm keeps track of the `max_gap` encountered so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "A boot is deemed usable if its maximum step size (`d`) is greater than or equal to the current `max_gap`. Because we process boots from most capable (highest `s`) to least capable, the `max_gap` is guaranteed to be non-decreasing. This greedy approach correctly determines the usability of each boot.

      "**Code Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The provided Python code solves the Farmer John snow boots problem efficiently. The core of the solution is an offline algorithm that processes the boots and tiles in a specific order to avoid redundant computations.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the input is parsed into the number of tiles (N), number of boots (B), a list of snow depths for each tile, and a list of boots with their capabilities (max snow depth s, max step size d). Each boot's original index is stored to produce the output in the correct order.\n",
      "\n",
      "The algorithm's main optimizations are:\n",
      "1.  Sorting Boots: The boots are sorted in descending order of their maximum snow depth capacity (s). This allows us to process the most capable boots first.\n",
      "2.  Sorting Tiles: The tiles with snow are sorted in descending order of their snow depth (f).\n",
      "3.  Efficient Path Management: The path of tiles is represented by a doubly linked list. This data structure allows for efficient removal of impassable tiles in O(1) time. An auxiliary array provides direct access to each node in the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "The code iterates through the sorted boots. For each boot, it first removes all tiles that are too deep for it. Since both boots and tiles are sorted by depth, this is done efficiently with a single pass over the tiles list. As tiles are removed from the linked list, the gap between the remaining passable tiles might increase. The algorithm keeps track of the max_gap encountered so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "A boot is deemed usable if its maximum step size (d) is greater than or equal to the current max_gap. Because we process boots from most capable (highest s) to least capable, the max_gap is guaranteed to be non-decreasing. This greedy approach correctly determines the usability of each boot. The final results are stored in a list, which is then returned. The overall time complexity is dominated by sorting, resulting in O(N log N + B log B).\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The algorithm's efficiency comes from sorting both the boots and the tiles. The boots are sorted in descending order of their maximum snow depth tolerance (`s`). The tiles (specifically, those with snow) are sorted in descending order of their snow depth (`f`).\n",
      "\n",
      "A doubly linked list is used to represent the path of tiles. This data structure allows for efficient removal of tiles (in O(1) time) as they become impassable. An auxiliary array, `node_pointers`, provides direct access to each node in the linked list by its tile index.\n",

      "The code then iterates through the sorted boots, from the most capable to the least. For each boot, it identifies all tiles that are now impassable (i.e., their snow depth is greater than the boot's tolerance). Because both boots and tiles are sorted by depth, this can be done in a single pass over the tiles list across all boot iterations.\n",
      "\n",
      "As each impassable tile is \"removed\" from the path (by updating the `next` and `prev` pointers in the linked list), the gap between its neighboring passable tiles is calculated. The algorithm maintains `max_gap`, the maximum gap encountered so far. A boot is deemed usable if its maximum step size (`d`) is greater than or equal to the current `max_gap`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the results (1 for usable, 0 for not) are stored in a list, which is ordered according to the original boot indices before being returned. This approach has a time complexity of O(N log N + B log B) due to the sorting steps, making it efficient enough for the given constraints.\n",

      "First, the input data (number of tiles N, number of boots B, snow depths f, and boot parameters s and d) is parsed. The boots are stored along with their original indices to reconstruct the final output order.\n",
      "\n",
      "The algorithm's efficiency comes from sorting both the boots and the tiles. The boots are sorted in descending order of their maximum snow depth tolerance (s). The tiles (specifically, those with snow) are sorted in descending order of their snow depth (f).\n",
      "\n",
      "A doubly linked list is used to represent the path of tiles. This data structure allows for efficient removal of tiles (in O(1) time) as they become impassable. An auxiliary array, node_pointers, provides direct access to each node in the linked list by its tile index.\n",
      "\n",
      "The code then iterates through the sorted boots, from the most capable to the least. For each boot, it identifies all tiles that are now impassable (i.e., their snow depth is greater than the boot's tolerance). Because both boots and tiles are sorted by depth, this can be done in a single pass over the tiles list across all boot iterations.\n",
      "\n",
      "As each impassable tile is \"removed\" from the path (by updating the next and prev pointers in the linked list), the gap between its neighboring passable tiles is calculated. The algorithm maintains max_gap, the maximum gap encountered so far. A boot is deemed usable if its maximum step size (d) is greater than or equal to the current max_gap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the results (1 for usable, 0 for not) are stored in a list, which is ordered according to the original boot indices before being returned. This approach has a time complexity of O(N log N + B log B) due to the sorting steps, making it efficient enough for the given constraints.\n",

      "The Python code provides a single function, `main_function`, to solve the Farmer John snow boots problem. The goal is to determine for each pair of boots if it's possible to travel from a starting tile to an ending tile across terrain with variable snow depth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The approach is an efficient greedy algorithm that avoids re-computing paths for each pair of boots. Here's a breakdown of the logic:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Input Parsing**: The function first parses the flat input list into `N` (number of tiles), `B` (number of boots), `f` (a list of snow depths for each tile), and a list of `boots`. Each boot is stored as a dictionary containing its maximum snow depth (`s`), maximum step size (`d`), and its original index to maintain the output order.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Sorting for Efficiency**:\n",
      "    *   The boots are sorted in descending order based on their maximum snow depth (`s`). This allows the algorithm to process the most capable boots first.\n",
      "    *   The tiles with snow are also sorted in descending order of their snow depth. This helps in efficiently identifying which tiles become impassable as we consider boots with progressively lower snow tolerance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Doubly Linked List for Path Tracking**: A doubly linked list is used to represent the sequence of passable tiles. Initially, all tiles are linked together. This data structure allows for efficient removal of impassable tiles (an O(1) operation) and quick calculation of the gap between the remaining adjacent passable tiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Iterative Processing**: The code iterates through the sorted boots, from most capable to least.\n",
      "    *   For each boot, it identifies all tiles that are too snowy for it (i.e., tile snow depth > boot's `s`).\n",
      "    *   These impassable tiles are \"removed\" from the path by updating the pointers in the doubly linked list.\n",
      "    *   As tiles are removed, the algorithm keeps track of `max_gap`, the maximum step size required to jump over any impassable sections.\n",
      "    *   A boot is deemed usable if its maximum step size (`d`) is greater than or equal to the current `max_gap`.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Result Aggregation**: The results (1 for usable, 0 for not) are stored in a `results` list. By using the `original_index` saved earlier, the final list is ordered correctly according to the input.\n",
      "\n",
      "This method is highly efficient because it processes each tile and boot once in a coordinated manner, with a time complexity of O(N log N + B log B) dominated by the initial sorting, which is well within typical time limits for competitive programming problems.\n",

      "The Python code defines a single function `main_function` that calculates the maximum possible score Elsie could achieve in a shell game. The game's swaps and guesses are provided as a flat list.\n",

It performs several checks to ensure the input is well-formed, such as verifying the list length, the range of `N`, and the validity of shell numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The core of the function simulates the game for each of the three possible initial positions of the pebble (shell 1, 2, or 3). For each starting position, it iterates through all the recorded swaps, updating the pebble's location accordingly. After each swap, it checks if Elsie's guess matches the pebble's new location and increments a score counter for that simulation run.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, after running the simulation for all three starting scenarios, it compares the scores obtained and returns the highest one, as this represents the maximum score Elsie could have earned. The result is returned as a single-element list.\n",

      "First, the code performs input validation. It checks if the input is a valid list, if `N` is within the specified range, and if the total length of the list corresponds to `N` swaps. It then parses the flat list into a more structured list of tuples, where each tuple `(a, b, g)` represents one move. During parsing, it also validates that shell numbers are between 1 and 3 and that the swapped shells `a` and `b` are not the same.\n",

      "Next, the core logic simulates the game for each of the three possible initial positions of the pebble (shell 1, 2, or 3). For each starting position, it iterates through all the recorded swaps. In each step, it updates the pebble's position based on the swap and checks if Elsie's guess was correct. The score for that particular starting scenario is incremented for each correct guess.\n",

      "The Python code defines a single function main_function that solves the shell game problem. The function takes a flat list as input, which contains the number of swaps N followed by N sets of three integers representing the shell swap (a, b) and Elsie's guess g.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the code performs input validation. It checks if the input is a valid list, if N is within the specified range, and if the total length of the list corresponds to N swaps. It then parses the flat list into a more structured list of tuples, where each tuple (a, b, g) represents one move. During parsing, it also validates that shell numbers are between 1 and 3 and that the swapped shells a and b are not the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the core logic simulates the game for each of the three possible initial positions of the pebble (shell 1, 2, or 3). For each starting position, it iterates through all the recorded swaps. In each step, it updates the pebble's position based on the swap and checks if Elsie's guess was correct. The score for that particular starting scenario is incremented for each correct guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the function keeps track of the maximum score found across all three simulations. After simulating all possible starting positions, it returns this maximum score as a single-element list, as required by the problem description.\n",

      "\n",
      "1.  **Input Parsing and Validation:** It first reads the input list. The first element `N` specifies the number of rounds (swaps and guesses). The function validates that `N` is within the allowed range and that the list length is consistent with `N`. It then parses the subsequent elements into a list of moves, where each move is a tuple `(a, b, g)` representing the swapping of shells `a` and `b`, followed by Elsie's guess `g`. It performs rigorous checks to ensure all shell numbers are valid (1, 2, or 3) and that `a` and `b` are distinct in any swap.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Game Simulation and Score Calculation:** The core of the algorithm is to simulate the game for each of the three possible starting positions of the pebble (shell 1, 2, or 3). For each starting position, it iterates through all the recorded moves. In each move, it updates the pebble's location based on the swap and checks if Elsie's guess was correct. The number of correct guesses for each starting scenario is tallied.\n",

      "\n",
      "The code is structured into two functions:\n",
      "1.  `_time_to_minutes(day, hour, minute)`: A helper function that converts a specific date and time into a single integer representing the total number of minutes that have passed since a reference point (November 11, 00:00). This simplifies the calculation of the time difference.\n",
      "2.  `main_function(end_time_list)`: The main function that takes the end time as a list `[Day, Hour, Minute]`. It uses the `_time_to_minutes` helper to convert both the fixed start time and the given end time into total minutes. It then calculates the difference. If the end time is earlier than the start time, the difference will be negative, and the function returns `[-1]` as required. Otherwise, it returns the calculated elapsed minutes in a list.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Modifications:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The previous code contained the entire logic within a single function. This version refactors the implementation by introducing a dedicated helper function, `_time_to_minutes`, for the time conversion logic. This change improves code modularity and readability, directly addressing the instructions for the current development step. The core calculation logic remains the same as it was already correct.\n",

      "\n",
      "This Python code provides a solution to the USACO \"Contest Timing\" problem. The goal is to calculate the total elapsed time in minutes from a fixed start time (November 11, 11:11) to a given end time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The code is structured into two functions:\n",
      "1.  `_time_to_minutes(day, hour, minute)`: A helper function that converts a specific date and time into a single integer representing the total number of minutes that have passed since a reference point (November 11, 00:00). This simplifies the calculation of the time difference.\n",
      "2.  `main_function(end_time_list)`: The main function that takes the end time as a list `[Day, Hour, Minute]`. It uses the `_time_to_minutes` helper to convert both the fixed start time and the given end time into total minutes. It then calculates the difference. If the end time is earlier than the start time, the difference will be negative, and the function returns `[-1]` as required. Otherwise, it returns the calculated elapsed minutes in a list.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Modifications:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The previous code contained the entire logic within a single function. This version refactors the implementation by introducing a dedicated helper function, `_time_to_minutes`, for the time conversion logic.

      "The Python code solves the \"Mooo Moo\" problem by calculating the minimum number of cows required to produce the observed mooing volumes in a series of fields. The solution is implemented in the `main_function`.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the function parses the input list to extract the number of fields (`N`), number of cow breeds (`B`), the mooing volume for each breed, and the observed volume in each field.\n",
      "\n",
      "The core of the solution involves two main parts:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Dynamic Programming for Minimum Cows:** A key subproblem is to find the minimum number of cows needed to produce a specific volume of sound. This is analogous to the classic change-making problem. The code pre-computes the solution for all possible required volumes up to the maximum observed volume using dynamic programming. An array `dp` is created where `dp[i]` stores the minimum number of cows to generate volume `i`. `dp[0]` is 0, and the table is filled iteratively. If a volume cannot be produced, its entry remains at infinity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Iterating Through Fields:** The code then iterates through each field from left to right. For each field, it calculates the `actual_volume_needed` by subtracting the sound that propagated from the previous field (`carried_volume`) from the `observed_volume`. The `carried_volume` is one less than the previous field's total observed volume (but not less than zero). Using the pre-computed `dp` table, it finds the minimum number of cows for this `actual_volume_needed` and adds it to the `total_cows`.\n",
      "\n",
      "If at any point the `actual_volume_needed` is negative (implying the observed sound is less than what should have propagated) or if the `dp` table indicates that the required volume is impossible to create, the function returns `[-1]`. Otherwise, it returns the calculated total minimum number of cows.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Python Code:**\n",

      "**Code Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Python code solves the \"Mooo Moo\" problem by calculating the minimum number of cows required to produce the observed mooing volumes in a series of fields. The solution is implemented in the `main_function`.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the function parses the input list to extract the number of fields (`N`), number of cow breeds (`B`), the mooing volume for each breed, and the observed volume in each field.\n",
      "\n",
      "The core of the solution involves two main parts:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Dynamic Programming for Minimum Cows:** A key subproblem is to find the minimum number of cows needed to produce a specific volume of sound. This is analogous to the classic change-making problem. The code pre-computes the solution for all possible required volumes up to the maximum observed volume using dynamic programming. An array `dp` is created where `dp[i]` stores the minimum number of cows to generate volume `i`. `dp[0]` is 0, and the table is filled iteratively. If a volume cannot be produced, its entry remains at infinity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Iterating Through Fields:** The code then iterates through each field from left to right. For each field, it calculates the `actual_volume_needed` by subtracting the sound that propagated from the previous field (`carried_volume`) from the `observed_volume`. The `carried_volume` is one less than the previous field's total observed volume (but not less than zero). Using the pre-computed `dp` table, it finds the minimum number of cows for this `actual_volume_needed` and adds it to the `total_cows`.\n",
      "\n",
      "If at any point the `actual_volume_needed` is negative (implying the observed sound is less than what should have propagated) or if the `dp` table indicates that the required volume is impossible to create, the function returns `[-1]`. Otherwise, it returns the calculated total minimum number of cows.\n",

      "The Python code provides a solution to the \"Delivery Route\" problem. The main logic is encapsulated in the main_function, which orchestrates the process, and a helper function _a_star_search, which calculates the shortest path for each segment of the route.\n",

      "\n",
      "The core of the solution involves iterating through each required travel segment (from farm 1 to 2, ..., N-1 to N, and finally N back to 1). For each segment, it calls the _a_star_search function. This function implements the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path on a grid between the start and end farms of the segment. All other farms are treated as obstacles that the path cannot cross. The cost of moving one step on the grid is one minute, and the A* algorithm uses the Manhattan distance as the heuristic to guide its search efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "If _a_star_search finds a path, it returns the path's length (time); otherwise, it returns None. If any segment is impassable, main_function immediately determines the entire route is impossible and returns [-1]. If all segments are successfully routed, their individual times are summed up to get the total delivery time, which is returned as a single-element list.\n",

      "The provided Python code solves the delivery route problem by calculating the minimum time required for a sequential tour of N farms. The solution is modularized into a main function and two helpers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The `main_function` orchestrates the process. It begins by parsing and validating the input data, which includes the number of farms (N) and their (x, y) coordinates. It stores farm locations in both a list for sequential access and a set for efficient lookups. The core of the function is a loop that iterates through each segment of the delivery route (farm 1 to 2, 2 to 3, ..., N to 1).\n",
      "\n",
      "For each segment, it calls the `_calculate_path_cost` function to determine the minimum travel time between the start and end farms, considering all other farms as potential obstacles. This helper function implements a robust shortest path algorithm. Instead of performing a search on the entire vast grid (which would be too slow given the coordinate range), it constructs a \"visibility graph\" whose vertices consist only of the start point, the end point, and the eight neighboring grid cells of each obstacle farm. This dramatically reduces the search space.\n",
      "\n",
      "The algorithm then runs Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm on this smaller, implicit graph. An edge between two waypoints in this graph exists only if the direct Manhattan path between them is not obstructed by any obstacle farm. The `_manhattan_distance` helper is used to calculate distances.\n",
      "\n",
      "If `_calculate_path_cost` finds that any segment is impossible to traverse, it returns -1, causing the `main_function` to terminate and return [-1]. Otherwise, the costs of all segments are summed up to get the total delivery time, which is returned as the final result. This approach correctly handles complex scenarios, such as when detours are required and those detours themselves might be blocked, by finding the true shortest path in the presence of obstacles.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Modifications:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The previous implementation used a standard A* search algorithm on the grid. While logically correct, this approach could be too slow for paths covering long distances, as it would need to store every visited grid cell. The new implementation replaces this with a more efficient algorithm based on a waypoint (or visibility) graph. This method is significantly faster because its complexity depends on the number of farms (N), which is small, rather than the large distances between them. The core pathfinding logic in `_a_star_search` has been replaced, and the function was renamed to `_calculate_path_cost` to more accurately describe its new implementation.\n",

      "\n",
      "The provided Python code solves the \"Delivery Route\" problem by calculating the minimum time for a farmer to visit a series of farms in a specific order and return to the start. The total time is the sum of the minimum times required for each segment of the journey (e.g., from farm `i` to farm `i+1`).\n",
      "\n",
      "The core of the solution is the `_calculate_path_cost` function, which finds the shortest path between two points (a `start` and `end` farm) on a large grid with a small number of obstacles (the other farms). A standard grid-based search like A* or BFS would be too slow given the coordinate range. Instead, this solution uses a more efficient approach based on a visibility graph and Dijkstra's algorithm.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key ideas are:\n",
      "1.  **Visibility Graph:** The search for a path is constrained to a small set of important points, called \"waypoints\". These waypoints include the start and end farms for the segment, as well as the eight grid points immediately surrounding each obstacle farm. This transforms the problem from searching an enormous grid to searching a small graph of at most `2 + 8 * (N-2)` nodes, where `N` is the total number of farms.\n",
      "2.  **Edge Weights:** An edge exists between two waypoints if a direct, straight-line path between them (traveling only North, South, East, or West) is not blocked by any other obstacle farm. The weight of the edge is simply the Manhattan distance between the two waypoints. A path is considered \"blocked\" if any obstacle lies within the rectangular bounding box defined by the two waypoints.\n",
      "3.  **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** With the waypoints as vertices and the calculated path costs as edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the `start` waypoint to the `end` waypoint.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main function, `main_function`, iterates through each required segment of the delivery route (farm 1 to 2, 2 to 3, ..., N to 1), calls `_calculate_path_cost` for each, and sums the results. If any segment is impossible to traverse (i.e., no path is found), the function returns `[-1]`. Otherwise, it returns the total calculated time.\n",

      "**Code Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The provided Python code solves the \"Delivery Route\" problem by calculating the minimum time for a farmer to visit a series of farms in a specific order and return to the start. The total time is the sum of the minimum times required for each segment of the journey (e.g., from farm `i` to farm `i+1`).\n",
      "\n",
      "The core of the solution is the `_calculate_path_cost` function, which finds the shortest path between two points (a `start` and `end` farm) on a large grid with a small number of obstacles (the other farms). A standard grid-based search like A* or BFS would be too slow given the coordinate range. Instead, this solution uses a more efficient approach based on a visibility graph and Dijkstra's algorithm.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key ideas are:\n",
      "1.  **Visibility Graph:** The search for a path is constrained to a small set of important points, called \"waypoints\". These waypoints include the start and end farms for the segment, as well as the eight grid points immediately surrounding each obstacle farm. This transforms the problem from searching an enormous grid to searching a small graph of at most `2 + 8 * (N-2)` nodes, where `N` is the total number of farms.\n",
      "2.  **Edge Weights:** An edge exists between two waypoints if a direct, straight-line path between them (traveling only North, South, East, or West) is not blocked by any other obstacle farm. The weight of the edge is simply the Manhattan distance between the two waypoints. A path is considered \"blocked\" if any obstacle lies within the rectangular bounding box defined by the two waypoints.\n",
      "3.  **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** With the waypoints as vertices and the calculated path costs as edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the `start` waypoint to the `end` waypoint.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main function, `main_function`, iterates through each required segment of the delivery route (farm 1 to 2, 2 to 3, ..., N to 1), calls `_calculate_path_cost` for each, and sums the results. If any segment is impossible to traverse (i.e., no path is found), the function returns `[-1]`. Otherwise, it returns the total calculated time.\n",

      "\n",
      "The provided Python code solves the \"Delivery Route\" problem by calculating the minimum time for a farmer to visit a series of farms in a specific order and return to the start. The total time is the sum of the minimum times required for each segment of the journey (e.g., from farm i to farm i+1).\n",
      "\n",
      "The core of the solution is the _calculate_path_cost function, which finds the shortest path between two points (a start and end farm) on a large grid with a small number of obstacles (the other farms). A standard grid-based search like A* or BFS would be too slow given the coordinate range. Instead, this solution uses a more efficient approach based on a visibility graph and Dijkstra's algorithm.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key ideas are:\n",
      "1.  Visibility Graph: The search for a path is constrained to a small set of important points, called \"waypoints\". These waypoints include the start and end farms for the segment, as well as the eight grid points immediately surrounding each obstacle farm. This transforms the problem from searching an enormous grid to searching a small graph of at most 2 + 8 * (N-2) nodes, where N is the total number of farms.\n",
      "2.  Edge Weights: An edge exists between two waypoints if a direct, straight-line path between them (traveling only North, South, East, or West) is not blocked by any other obstacle farm. The weight of the edge is simply the Manhattan distance between the two waypoints. A path is considered \"blocked\" if any obstacle lies within the rectangular bounding box defined by the two waypoints.\n",
      "3.  Dijkstra's Algorithm: With the waypoints as vertices and the calculated path costs as edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the start waypoint to the end waypoint.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main function, main_function, iterates through each required segment of the delivery route (farm 1 to 2, 2 to 3, ..., N to 1), calls _calculate_path_cost for each, and sums the results. If any segment is impossible to traverse (i.e., no path is found), the function returns [-1]. Otherwise, it returns the total calculated time.\n",

      "\n",
      "The problem asks for the number of distinct paintings of a canvas of length `N` using `M` colored stamps of width `K`. A key insight is that the problem can be modeled as partitioning the `N` units of the canvas into monochromatic blocks, where each block has a length of at most `K`. This is because any valid painting sequence must fully cover the canvas. A sequence of stamp placements effectively results in such a partitioned coloring. For example, placing a stamp of color 'A' of length `K` followed by an overlapping stamp of color 'B' results in a painting with two monochromatic blocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "This combinatorial counting problem can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming. Let `dp[i]` be the number of ways to paint a canvas of length `i`. We can derive a linear recurrence relation for `dp[i]`.\n",
      "\n",
      "A valid painting of length `i` can be formed by extending a valid painting of length `i-1`.\n",
      "- We can append a block of length 1.\n",
      "- Or a block of length 2, and so on, up to length `K`.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of ways to paint a canvas of length `i`, `dp[i]`, can be expressed as the sum of ways of forming it by appending a final monochromatic block of length `L` (where `1 <= L <= K`) to a valid painting of length `i-L`.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recurrence relation that correctly models this problem is:\n",
      "`dp[i] = M * dp[i-1] - (M-1) * dp[i-K]` for `i >= K`.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the base cases, when the canvas length `i` is less than the stamp width `K`, any of the `M` colors can be placed at any position without restriction, leading to `M^i` possibilities. However, the logic of partitioning into blocks of size at most `K` leads to a slightly different set of base cases that seamlessly integrate with the recurrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The base cases are:\n",
      "- `dp[0] = 1` (representing an empty canvas).\n",
      "- `dp[i] = M^i` for `1 <= i < K`.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final algorithm is as follows:\n",
      "1. Initialize a DP array, `dp`, of size `N + 1`.\n",
      "2. Set `dp[0] = 1`.\n",
      "3. Compute `dp[i] = M^i % MOD` for `i` from 1 to `K-1`.\n",
      "4. For `i` from `K` to `N`, apply the recurrence: `dp[i] = (M * dp[i-1] - (M-1) * dp[i-K]) % MOD`.\n",
      "5. The final answer is `dp[N]`.\n",

      "The problem asks for the number of distinct paintings of a canvas of length `N` using `M` colored stamps of width `K`. A key insight is that the problem can be modeled as partitioning the `N` units of the canvas into monochromatic blocks, where each block has a length of at most `K`. This is because any valid painting sequence must fully cover the canvas. A sequence of stamp placements effectively results in such a partitioned coloring. For example, placing a stamp of color 'A' of length `K` followed by an overlapping stamp of color 'B' results in a painting with two monochromatic blocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "This combinatorial counting problem can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming. Let `dp[i]` be the number of ways to paint a canvas of length `i`. We can derive a linear recurrence relation for `dp[i]`.\n",

      "\n",
      "For the base cases, when the canvas length `i` is less than the stamp width `K`, any of the `M` colors can be placed at any position without restriction, leading to `M^i` possibilities.

The problem, as interpreted by the recurrence, is equivalent to finding the number of strings of length `i` over `M` colors that do not contain any monochromatic block of length `K`.\n",

      "`dp[i] = (M * dp[i-1] - (M - 1) * dp[i-K]) % MOD`\n",

      "This recurrence only depends on the `(i-1)`-th and `(i-K)`-th states. Instead of storing all `N` states in a list, we can use a circular array (or a list with modulo indexing) of size `K` to store only the necessary previous states. This reduces the memory usage from `O(N)` to `O(K)`.\n",
      "\n",

      "**Modifications:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The previous implementation used a list of size `N+1` to store the dynamic programming states, resulting in `O(N)` space complexity. The main modification in this version is the replacement of this list with a smaller list of size `K`, using modulo arithmetic on the indices (`i % K`) to simulate a circular array. This optimization reduces the space complexity to `O(K)` while maintaining the `O(N)` time complexity. This is particularly beneficial when `K` is much smaller than `N`, and is essential for handling the largest input constraints within typical memory limits.\n",

      "The solution calculates the number of possible paintings by first establishing a structural property of any valid painting and then using combinatorics to count them.\n",
      "\n",
      "A painting is valid if it can be constructed by applying stamps of width K. A detailed analysis reveals that this is possible if and only if the painting, when viewed as a sequence of monochromatic blocks, has the property that all \"internal\" blocks (i.e., not at the very beginning or end of the canvas) have a length of at least K. The first and last blocks can have any length (>= 1).\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this property, the problem is reduced to counting the number of ways to partition the integer N (canvas length) into k parts (L_1, L_2, ..., L_k) that sum to N, subject to the constraints L_1 >= 1, L_k >= 1, and L_j >= K for 1 < j < k. For each such partition, there are M * (M-1)^(k-1) ways to color the blocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The core of the algorithm is a loop that iterates through the number of possible blocks, k, from 2 to N. For each k, it calculates:\n",
      "1. The number of valid partitions of N into k blocks using a stars-and-bars combinatorial argument. This results in the formula C(N - (k-2)*(K-1) - 1, k-1).\n",
      "2. The number of ways to color these k blocks, which is M * (M-1)^(k-1).\n",
      "\n",
      "The total number of non-monochromatic paintings is the sum of the products of these two quantities over all possible k. The M monochromatic paintings are added to this sum to get the final answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "To handle large inputs efficiently, the implementation precomputes factorials and their modular inverses up to N, allowing for O(1) calculation of combinations. The powers of (M-1) are calculated iteratively within the loop. This results in an overall time complexity of O(N).\n",
