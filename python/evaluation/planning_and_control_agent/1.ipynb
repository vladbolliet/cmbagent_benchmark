      "The main_function first validates the input using the helper. It then computes the absolute difference using the built-in abs() function and returns the result as a single-element list, as required. An assertion is included to verify the output format before returning. The code includes example usage to demonstrate its functionality with valid inputs, including positive, negative, and large numbers, and to show the error handling for invalid inputs.\n",
