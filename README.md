COPY PASTE TEMPLATE FOR V3

Migration and Testing Request Template (with Output Redirection)

Create a new folder called new_code_v3.
Copy the core/ directory from new_code_v2 into new_code_v3/.
Inside new_code_v3, create a folder called testing.
Inside new_code_v3/testing/, create a folder for the module you are testing (e.g., data_structures/).
In that module folder (e.g., new_code_v3/testing/data_structures/), create:
a tester file (e.g., data_structures_tester.py)
an output file (e.g., data_structures_testing_output.txt)
In the tester .py file, write comprehensive tests (including multiple examples and edge cases) for every class, function, and feature implemented in the corresponding file from core/ (e.g., core/data_structures.py).
All test output (including errors, print statements, and results) should be redirected to the output file (e.g., data_structures_testing_output.txt) instead of the terminal.
Repeat this process for each file: copy the file to new_code_v3/core/, then create a corresponding tester and output file in new_code_v3/testing/<module>/, and write thorough tests for it.
After each step, run the tests and check the output file to ensure everything works before proceeding to the next file.
